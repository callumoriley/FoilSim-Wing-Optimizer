# FoilSim-Wing-Optimizer
A program to generate custom airfoils given flight parameters and an optimization parameter using code from NASA's FoilSimJS

WingOptimizer.js is the file that my program uses, but FoilSimStudent_Calc_Original.js is the original program downloaded from NASA's website [here](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/FoilSim/index.html).
